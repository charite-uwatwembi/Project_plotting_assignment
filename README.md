# Project: Visualizing Relationships in Data with Matplotlib and Seaborn


This project involves using the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries to create and interpret diagrams that visualize the relationships between various features (columns) in a dataset. The goal is to gain insights into how different variables are interconnected, which can be crucial for data analysis and decision-making processes.
